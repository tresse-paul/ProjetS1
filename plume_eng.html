          <h3 class="text__title">Writing to denounce</h3>
          <p>Writing is a way for her to denounce. Known today as an editor and journalist, but above all as an <strong>activist</strong>. Gloria was involved in the creation of New York magazine in 1968. As a result, she was assigned to write the political section. In 1968, a woman in charge of this column was unimaginable. With her experience and audacity, she wanted to create a magazine for women.
          <br><br>The magazine was <strong>feminist</strong> in nature, providing a reflection on the place of women. Unlike other <em>magazines dealing with fashion and beauty</em>, she wanted something strong. In December 1971, as a supplement to the weekly newspaper New York, Ms. magazine appeared. This magazine was the work of Gloria and the African-American activist Dorothy Pitman Hughes. It was a success! 300,000 copies were sold in an 8-day period in the United States. For 15 years, Gloria was the editor-in-chief and is still on the advisory board. In 2001, the magazine was sold to a foundation called the Feminist Majority Foundation. The non-profit foundation aims to <strong>combat violence and economic inequality against women</strong>.
          <br><br>Her mastery of the written word has led to several landmark works. In particular, her book Outrageous Actions and Daily Rebellions. In 26 stories spanning 15 years of her life, she denounces inequality and injustice. Gloria talks about her experience at the Playboy Club in New York and the negative effects of patriarchy on women. But the main purpose of these works is to promote social change. She wants the lives of these readers to not be dictated by <a class="ancre__glossaire" href="glossaire_eng.html#patriarchy">patriarchal</a> <strong>politics</strong>.</p>

          <h3 class="text__title">A life of advocacy and daring</h3>
          <p>25 March 1934, northeastern of the United States, Ohio, Gloria Marie Steinem was born. Her father was an antique dealer and her mother a journalist. Her family was to be an example for her future life. Her grandmother was at that time the president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. This association aimed to <strong>promote women's right to vote</strong>. During her childhood, she spent years on the road, escaping from school. It was a brainwashing environment for girls according to her father. So denying the rules is an integral part of her behaviour.
          <br><br>After graduating in 1956, she went to India for two years on a scholarship. Even then, she took part in <strong>demonstrations against the country's politics</strong>. Back in New York, she was hired as a journalist. During the next few years, various events were to leave their mark. Like her infiltration of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Club or her involvement in radical feminist rallies. A strong and fearless woman, paper and ink will not be her only universe. Politics will be a second way for her to <strong>change people's minds</strong>.</p>

          <h3 class="text__title">Politically inspiring speeches</h3>
          <p>Gloria Steinem is one of the most emblematic women of feminism today. She fearlessly faces challenges and excels in the fields she tackles. At the age of 39, she was responsible, along with several other women, for organising the 1977 <strong>National Women's Conference</strong>. Used to travelling, she travelled across the states, involving 18,000 women who attended the conference. The conference addressed issues such as welfare, contraception, domestic violence and many others. She wrote in her autobiography in later years, "It was one of the most moving events of my life.
          <br><br>Together with Jane Fonda and Robin Morgan, they founded an organisation called the Women's Media Center. She also joined the National Women's Political Caucus and the Coalition of Labor Union Women. She became a major <strong>feminist spokesperson</strong> for the women's liberation movement. As proof of her influence, she has been travelling the world since 2018 to debate equality. In 2013, <strong>Gloria Marie Steinem was awarded</strong> the Medal of Freedom by the current president, Barack Obama.</p>
